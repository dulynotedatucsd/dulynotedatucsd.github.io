      <description>Credits: Kristina Tran and Aretha Li&#xA;WHO ARE WE? We are the seventh of nine a cappella groups found on campus at University of California, San Diego. Founded in Fall 2012, we&#39;ve made strides to get to where we are today. Together, our members sing and perform, united by a love of music. Comprised of nearly 20 talented students from UCSD, Duly Noted sings a diverse repertoire of music. Each year, the group sings new arrangements composed by our members.</description>
