    <h1 class="section-title">WHO ARE WE?</h1>
    <p>
        We are the seventh of nine a cappella groups found on campus at
        University of California, San Diego. Founded in Fall 2012, we've made
        strides to get to where we are today. Together, our members sing and
        perform, united by a love of music.
    </p>
    <p>
        Comprised of nearly 20 talented students from UCSD, Duly Noted sings a
        diverse repertoire of music. Each year, the group sings new arrangements
        composed by our members. Duly Noted also hosts three yearly concerts,
        performs at on-campus events, attends festivals, and competes at the
        International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella.
    </p>

    <h1 class="section-title">OUR MISSION</h1>
    <p>
        Members not only share a love for singing, but also for each other. Duly
        Noted is a spirited group of people who work hard to achieve the group's
        goals, and still have time to devote to their passions and studies. Some
        current and former members are successful programmers at Smule,
        Finanical Analysts in SF, artists at AX, double majors, activists in our
        community, and Med School students. Duly Noted isn't just an a cappella
        group: it's an amazing place where dedication is key, firnedhips are
        made, and everyone has fun!
