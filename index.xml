We are the seventh of nine a cappella groups found on campus at University of California, San Diego. Founded in Fall 2012, we've made strides to get to where we are today. Together, our members sing and perform, united by a love of music. Comprised of nearly 20 talented students from UCSD, Duly Noted sings a diverse repertoire of music. Each year, the group sings new arrangements composed by our members.</description></item></channel></rss>
