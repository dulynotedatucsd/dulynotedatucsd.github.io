  question: "Can I audition for multiple groups?"

    You can audition for as many groups as you want! We also encourage it to
    find the best for you! If you are accepted into multiple groups, however,
    you can only <u>choose one.</u>

  question: "Can I have a backing track?"
  answer: >
    No. Any form of accompaniment can make it difficult for us to hear your
    timbre and tone. Although it is okay for you to read lyrics, we strongly
    prefer you have them memorized. We can also provide your starting pitch if
    needed.

  question: "If I make it into Duly, what's the time commitment like?"
  answer: >
    Expect to devote about 9 hours per week: two 3-hour full group rehearsals
    and one 2-hour sectional. Times vary each quarter based on members'
    schedules. Extra time may be needed during competition years for gigs, and
    recording sessions.
