<h2>Passionate to <span class="secondary-color">learn</span> and <span class="secondary-color">sing</span>?</h2>
<p>
  We are looking for passionate singers and vocal percussionists of any skill
  level to add their unique voices to our dynamic ensemble. Experience is
  helpful but not necessary. Whether you have formal training or just sing in
  the shower, everyone is welcome. Natural talent is valued, so don't hesitate
  to audition!
</p>
<p>
  Usually held beginning of every Fall Quarter, auditions are open to all UCSD
  students, so come show us what you've got and be part of a community that
  values music, creativity, and camaraderie!
