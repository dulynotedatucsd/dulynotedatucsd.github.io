<h1 class="section-title">WHO ARE WE?</h1>
<p>
  We are the seventh of nine a cappella groups found on campus at
  University of California, San Diego. Founded in Fall 2012, we've made
  strides to get to where we are today. Together, our members sing and
  perform, united by a love of music.
</p>
<p>
  Comprised of nearly 20 talented students from UCSD, Duly Noted sings a
  diverse repertoire of music. Each year, the group sings new arrangements
  composed by our members. Duly Noted also hosts three yearly concerts,
  performs at on-campus events, attends festivals, and competes at the
  International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella.

<h1 class="section-title">OUR MISSION</h1>
<p>
  Members not only share a love for singing, but also for each other. Duly
  Noted is a spirited group of people who work hard to achieve the group's
  goals, and still have time to devote to their passions and studies. Some
  current and former members are successful programmers at Smule,
  Financial Analysts in SF, artists at AX, double majors, activists in our
  community, and Med School students. Duly Noted isn't just an a cappella
  group: it's an amazing place where dedication is key, friendships are
  made, and everyone has fun!
